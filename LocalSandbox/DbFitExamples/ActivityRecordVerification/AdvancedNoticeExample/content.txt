!3 Get the ADVANCED NOTICE activities, with ACTMISC broken out by the SQL query.
We are querying by TRANSNBR and TRANSTYPE, both of which are at the 
front of the activity record.  We could also query on ACCTNBR and TRANSTYPE.
!4 If a query like this were available for all transtypes, we could verify most activity records using Db Fit with ease.

    SUBSTR(ACTMISC,1,12) AS PRODNBR,

!3 Now verify the 24 activities that relate to this order. We don't verify transaction number this time, since we don't know it.
