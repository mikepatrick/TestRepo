!3 Get the RESUME activities, with ACTMISC broken out by the SQL query.
We are querying by TRANSNBR and TRANSTYPE, both of which are at the 
front of the activity record.  We could also query on ACCTNBR and TRANSTYPE.
!4 If a query like this were available for all transtypes, we could verify most activity records using Db Fit with ease.

!|Query|!- SELECT ACCTNBR, TRANSNBR, OPERID, TRANSTYPE,            
  SUBSTR(HEX(ACTMISC),1,15) AS ORDNBR,
  SUBSTR(HEX(ACTMISC),17,5) AS INVOICE
         FROM CLTLIBd6x.XACTIVITY0 WHERE  
         TRANSTYPE = 18
         AND ACCTNBR = 37047180
         AND TRANSNBR > 113126000000001                          -!|
|ACCTNBR?|TRANSNBR?|OPERID?|TRANSTYPE?|ORDNBR?        | INVOICE? | 
|        |         |       |          |               |        | 
|        |         |       |          |               |        | 



!3 Now verify the 18 activities that relate to this order. We don't verify transaction number this time, since we don't know it.

!|Query|!- SELECT ACCTNBR, TRANSNBR, OPERID, TRANSTYPE,                 
  SUBSTR(HEX(ACTMISC),1,15) AS ORDNBR,
  SUBSTR(HEX(ACTMISC),17,5) AS INVOICE
    FROM CLTLIBD6X.XACTIVITY0 WHERE TRANSTYPE = 18
         AND ACCTNBR = 37047180      
         AND TRANSNBR > 113126000000001                          -!|
