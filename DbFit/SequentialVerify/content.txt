!1 Run this suite to execute the application and verify steps for all orders.

!4 This set of suites takes an approach that involves running two tests per order:

!5 * 1. Use Cds_RestFixture to test the RESTful service and perform XPath and other necessary verifications on the HTTP response.
!5 * 2. Use the DB2Test fixture from Db_Fit to perform SQL verifications against the client database.

!4 Each test is implemented as a suite because each pair of tests for an order is intended to be run in sequence (apply, then verify).  Use the [Suite] button, not the [Test] button for this collection of tests.
